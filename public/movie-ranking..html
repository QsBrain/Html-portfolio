<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>Shrek always is an enjoyable good time.</p>

<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>Great way to give black people an opportunity to showcase our super heros onto the big screen.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Love the action and how John Wick is able, against all odds, to survive and get rid of those who want him dead.</p>
